## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to how media coverage of the election changes the behavior of it. 




Have you ever wondered how national news media coverage affects elections? I plan to examine how media coverage affects the electorate's behavior in this study. I hypothesize that national news media coverage will likely substantially influence the electorate's behavior. I affirm this because most citizens believe everything they get from news sources, and by believing the information, they are adopting the same political beliefs as the news source, ultimately shifting the election outcome. News sources can also push the political agenda by telling one side of a story, which electorates sympathize with and conform to the propaganda the sources are trying to push. However, this acutely insinuates that all news sources are bad, which is incredibly untrue. It can shine a light on candidates' ideals or actions, changing how electorates view the candidate they support. The explanatory variable is whether the town got Fox News; they would project conservative news to the subscribers if they did. This is the column: subrf2000. The outcomes are measured in the percentage of the town that voted for the Republican political party. The data supports my hypothesis that media coverage affects the electorate's behavior because it is seen through the data that a town that had Fox News subscribers has shifted towards the Republican party as elections went on. After all, the percentage of the town voting right-wing grew or increased. Subsequently, this affirms that the media affects the behavior of the electorate.
